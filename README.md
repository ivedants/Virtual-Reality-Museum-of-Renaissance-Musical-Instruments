# Virtual-Reality-Museum-of-Renaissance-Musical-Instruments
This project focuses on making an immersive VR experience for an exhibit of a Museum of Musical Instruments from the Renaissance era. It includes the capability of being able to interact with 30 various instruments of various ages throughout history, their evolution, and their classification and role in todayâ€™s musical world. It also includes small audio clips of the instruments attached to their 3D Models so that the users can tap/click on them and listen to how the instrument sounded like. Alongside this, the project also features some interactive videos which can be accessed in browser mode to understand better about some of the most groundbreaking instruments of the Renaissance period.
