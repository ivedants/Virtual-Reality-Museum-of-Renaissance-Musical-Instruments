# Virtual-Reality-Museum-of-Renaissance-Musical-Instruments
This award-winning project focuses on making an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) experience for an exhibit of a Museum of Musical Instruments from the Renaissance era. It includes the capability of being able to interact with 30 various instruments of various ages throughout history, their evolution, and their classification and role in todayâ€™s musical world. It also includes small audio clips of the instruments attached to their 3D Models so that the users can tap/click on them and listen to how the instrument sounded like. Alongside this, the project also features some interactive videos which can be accessed in browser mode to understand better about some of the most groundbreaking instruments of the Renaissance period. 

**Tools Used**

1. AWS Sumerian
2. Adobe Photoshop
3. Rhinoceros 3D

**Award**

This project won the Best Project (Public Choice) Award under the Virtual Reality Projects category at the Festival of Animation - Fall 2020 at The George Washington University, Washington D.C., USA.

## Getting Started [FIND PROJECT LINK AND PREVIEW VIDEO LINK HERE]

There are two ways to access this project. One is to simply access it through a web browser (Google Chrome, recommended for best performance) or through your VR Headset browser. The project link is:  https://c54237d0af0b40a2ac35b70846537582.us-east-2.sumerian.aws/?

For a quick insight of this project, here is the link to a short video of the museum: https://youtu.be/RLCYF9-hMKg

## VR Application Design

**Navigation via teleportation:** The app features three different areas - the welcome room which acts as the first room the visitors visit upon their entry, the gallery which features 9 instruments on either of its two sides, and the central room which features 6 instruments each on both its sides. Navigation via teleportation would be a handy option for users who are not willing to walk every step physically to the other rooms.

**Guiding audio/sound effects:** The visitors can interact with all the instruments and listen to their sounds. They can also click on the videos in Browser Mode and enjoy learning more from them about music during the Renaissance Period.

**Text instructions:** The museum is acquainted with various floating text instructions at multiple places to instruct the visitors about how to interact with all the featured instruments. The museum also features text besides all the instruments so that the users can read them and learn more about each and every instrument in the exhibit.

**Instructional signs/wayfinders:** The app has floating text at various places pointing to different rooms and instruments just like a real world museum.
Activities involving Six Degrees of Freedom (6DOF): Users would be able to walk around in the museum and look at the objects from all angles. This would make them feel as if they are actually in a real world museum.

## Integration

**Data Collection:** One of the first and biggest challenges in this project was to gather enough data from trustworthy sources. All the information about the instruments featured in this project has been collected from various sources such as websites of various museums around the world, various music schools, sources like wikipedia, and more.

**Processing audio files:** The audio files collected had to be edited and cleaned for better experience in the VR. The editing and cleaning was done using Apple Garageband.

**Making 3D Models of the instruments:** All the 3D Models of all the musical instruments in this project have been **custom designed** by me using **Adobe Photoshop and Rhinoceros 3D**. The objects have been used in .OBJ file format while their textures are in JPEG file format.
